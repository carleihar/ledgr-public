## Project title
Log the stuff you buy. It's just that simple.

## Motivation

Are you bad with money? Do you find yourself buying a $460 yearly subscription to peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, then not being able to pay rent and wondering why? Have you tried one of those pesky budgeting apps that want your bank login information, your social security number, and your most embarassing moment, only for it to somehow categorize your trip to Target as "grocery", and not "trip to get an absurd amount of candy that can't possibly be healthy and a 3000 piece puzzle on a friday night, this seems really sad Caroline", where it clearly belongs? Are you slightly neurotic and love entering data to track where it all went wrong? Well you're not alone! So I made ledgr--a simple money tracking app. No bank connections, no internet connection, no logging in--just track the crap you buy.

## Tests
I've written only a handful of tests, just to make sure my mom won't be proud of me. But you get the gist, right?

## How to use?
Find it on the [app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ledgr-simple-spending-logger/id1496833269?ls=1). Then log.

## Credits
I have done all the design, including the icon, but the category icons can be found [here](https://freeicons.io/style/Outline).

#### TODO
* Refactor visual presenter, it's weird
* Finish test coverage (UI and unit)
* Tons of features
